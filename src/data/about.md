# During College
- I graduated with honors from Purdue University with a bachelor’s in planetary sciences in May 2024. 
- While an undergraduate student, I worked as a research assistant in the Department of Physics and Astronomy (topic being lithium abundances in red-giant branch (RGB) stars in the globular cluster M10), and had the opportunity to present findings in January 2024 at the 243rd American Astronomical Society (AAS) meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana. 
- For a briefer period, I also worked as a research assistant in the Department of Health and Human Sciences (topic being the experiences of Asian and Asian American adolescents who had grown up in the Midwest), presenting findings in November 2023 at Purdue’s Undergraduate Research Expo.
- Finally, I worked with Purdue’s Chinese Calligraphy Club as treasurer and the Asian American and Asian Resource Cultural Center (AAARCC) as part of the student staff extensively during the last two years of my undergraduate study, expanding my interest and understanding of the broader Asian/Asian American community and also just a passion for learning more about Asian culture in general.

# Art Pursuits
- I am a self-taught artist (primary media being pencils and pens), and have been drawing for over 14 years, my focus being portrait art with a manga/anime-like style. For my art business, I draw portraits on little sketch cards (each about the size of a credit card), which brings me to my Etsy store: Click here if you’re interested and would like to buy some of my drawings! I accept commissions
- I’m also an indie musician/singer-songwriter and pianist; currently I have a few albums and several singles released on most streaming platforms (hyperlinked here): Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, and Amazon Music are a few
- Last, I’m a freelance translator with a deep interest in language learning :D I took two Japanese classes in high school and fell in love with the language, so I’ve been learning it on my own ever since. In the years since, I’ve translated several songs, writing inscribed on vintage toys (like a Jolly Chimp!), a Wikipedia article, and a short film (you didn’t hear it from me, but Google “project 925 reddit” and you should find a post that hyperlinks to an unlisted YouTube video of said short film…my disclaimer: I did NOT translate for money, I just wanted to watch the movie with subtitles :D).


In any case, thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy what you find on my website!
